Use this package to execute shell commands from within the programs
you have so defiantly not written in Python or Ruby.  Calling
SHELLSHOCK:ARM will set #! as a macro character, so you can write
shell commands in your program without any hyper-quoting.  From #! to
the end of the line will be replaced with a closure that runs that
shell command exactly, collecting stdout and stderr into a string.

Heaven help you if the child process wants input, hangs, or if
anything at all goes wrong.

There's an .asd file.  You know what to do.
